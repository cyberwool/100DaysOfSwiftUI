# Milestone 2: *Unicorn Multiplication*
https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/3/3/challenge

>Your goal is to build an “edutainment” app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – “what is 7 x 8?” and so on. Edutainment apps are educational at their core, but ideally have enough playfulness about them to make kids want to play.

Features a pastel color palette and animated unicorns, stars, and clouds.

>2. The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, or 20.
>3. You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for.
